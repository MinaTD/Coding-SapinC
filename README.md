# Coding-SapinC

Hi! 

As you will go through the following steps, you will have instructions on how to handle this code to display a fir in your terminal.

1 - First you have to compile the file with the 'cc file_name' command.

2 - Then you have to execute your file as following: './executable_file_name size_of_your_fir'. For example: './fir 5' to display a fir with 5 grounds.
